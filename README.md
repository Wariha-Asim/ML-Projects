# Machine Learning Projects: Loan Approval & Student Performance

This repository contains my completed tasks as part of the Elevvo Machine Learning Internship.  
The projects focus on applying supervised machine learning techniques for both **classification** and **regression** problems.

##  Projects Included

### 1. Loan Approval Prediction (Classification)
- **Objective:** Predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on applicant details.  
- **Dataset Features:** Income, Loan Amount, CIBIL Score, Education, Self-Employed, Asset Values, etc.  
- **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix  
- **Visualizations:** Loan status distribution, Loan status vs Education, Model comparison

### 2. Student Performance Prediction (Regression)
- **Objective:** Predict students’ exam scores based on study-related and personal factors.  
- **Dataset Features:** Hours Studied, Previous Scores, Sleep Hours, Attendance, Teacher Quality, etc.  
- **Models Used:** Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression (Degree 2)  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² Score  
- **Visualizations:** Actual vs Predicted plots, Attendance vs Average Score, Study hours correlation

## Key Highlights
- Hands-on application of **Supervised Learning (Classification & Regression)**  
- Data preprocessing including **handling missing values, encoding, and scaling**  
- Performance comparison of multiple models with visual insights  
- End-to-end workflow from raw dataset → preprocessing → training → evaluation → visualization
